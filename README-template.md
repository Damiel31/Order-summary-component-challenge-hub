## My process

### Built with

- Sass
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned a lot of things as a beginner such as Flexbox manipulation and Sass nesting and its fun and rewarding to complete the challenge.



### Continued development

I need to be faster at thinking how to do the Flexbox  manipulation efficiently and the position css element also needs to familiarize it better and lastly my sass manipulation because i dont know if my nesting is correct or not let me know if its good.
